        <div class="info" id="tribute-info"><em>Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">David Attenborough</a> is an English broadcaster and naturalist, and one of the most respected TV broadcasters. He is best known for writing and presenting the nine natural history documentary series in the "Life" collection, that document a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth. Often referred to as  "the great communicator, the peerless educator", and "the greatest broadcaster of our time", David Attenborough helped shape not only the style of the natural history documentaries, but TV broadcasting as we know it. Widely considered an international treasure, he consistently continues to raise awareness of natural preservation and climate change.</em></div>
